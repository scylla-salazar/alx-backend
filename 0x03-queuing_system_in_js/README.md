0x03. Queuing System in JS


Tasks
0. Install a redis instance
mandatory
Download, extract, and compile the latest stable Redis version (higher than 5.0.7 - https://redis.io/downloads/):

$ wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-6.0.10.tar.gz
$ tar xzf redis-6.0.10.tar.gz
$ cd redis-6.0.10
$ make
Start Redis in the background with src/redis-server
$ src/redis-server &
Make sure that the server is working with a ping src/redis-cli ping
PONG
Using the Redis client again, set the value School for the key Holberton
127.0.0.1:[Port]> set Holberton School
OK
127.0.0.1:[Port]> get Holberton
"School"
Kill the server with the process id of the redis-server (hint: use ps and grep)
$ kill [PID_OF_Redis_Server]
Copy the dump.rdb from the redis-5.0.7 directory into the root of the Queuing project.

Requirements:

Running get Holberton in the client, should return School



[200~1. Node Redis Client
mandatory
Install node_redis using npm

Using Babel and ES6, write a script named 0-redis_client.js. It should connect to the Redis server running on your machine:

It should log to the console the message Redis client connected to the server when the connection to Redis works correctly
It should log to the console the message Redis client not connected to the server: ERROR_MESSAGE when the connection to Redis does not work
Requirements:

To import the library, you need to use the keyword import


2. Node Redis client and basic operations
mandatory
In a file 1-redis_op.js, copy the code you previously wrote (0-redis_client.js).

Add two functions:

setNewSchool:
It accepts two arguments schoolName, and value.
It should set in Redis the value for the key schoolName
It should display a confirmation message using redis.print
displaySchoolValue:
It accepts one argument schoolName.
It should log to the console the value for the key passed as argument
At the end of the file, call:

displaySchoolValue('Holberton');
setNewSchool('HolbertonSanFrancisco', '100');
displaySchoolValue('HolbertonSanFrancisco');
Requirements:

Use callbacks for any of the operation, we will look at async operations later



3. Node Redis client and async operations
mandatory
In a file 2-redis_op_async.js, let’s copy the code from the previous exercise (1-redis_op.js)

Using promisify, modify the function displaySchoolValue to use ES6 async / await

Same result as 1-redis_op.js



4. Node Redis client and advanced operations
mandatory
In a file named 4-redis_advanced_op.js, let’s use the client to store a hash value

Create Hash:
Using hset, let’s store the following:

The key of the hash should be HolbertonSchools
It should have a value for:
Portland=50
Seattle=80
New York=20
Bogota=20
Cali=40
Paris=2
Make sure you use redis.print for each hset
Display Hash:
Using hgetall, display the object stored in Redis. It should return the following:

Requirements:

Use callbacks for any of the operation, we will look at async operations later



5. Node Redis client publisher and subscriber
mandatory
In a file named 5-subscriber.js, create a redis client:

On connect, it should log the message Redis client connected to the server
On error, it should log the message Redis client not connected to the server: ERROR MESSAGE
It should subscribe to the channel holberton school channel
When it receives message on the channel holberton school channel, it should log the message to the console
When the message is KILL_SERVER, it should unsubscribe and quit
In a file named 5-publisher.js, create a redis client:

On connect, it should log the message Redis client connected to the server
On error, it should log the message Redis client not connected to the server: ERROR MESSAGE
Write a function named publishMessage:
It will take two arguments: message (string), and time (integer - in ms)
After time millisecond:
The function should log to the console About to send MESSAGE
The function should publish to the channel holberton school channel, the message passed in argument after the time passed in arguments
At the end of the file, call:



6. Create the Job creator
mandatory
In a file named 6-job_creator.js:

Create a queue with Kue
Create an object containing the Job data with the following format:
{
  phoneNumber: string,
  message: string,
}
Create a queue named push_notification_code, and create a job with the object created before
When the job is created without error, log to the console Notification job created: JOB ID
When the job is completed, log to the console Notification job completed
When the job is failing, log to the console Notification job failed
